## Sample Phishing Email

üìé Attachment: Account_Verification_Form.zip

Failure to complete verification within 24 hours will result in permanent suspension.

Thank you for your cooperation,

support@secure-update-login.com

### 2. **Check for Email Spoofing**
- Domain: `secure-update-login.com` is not affiliated with any trusted service.
- MXToolbox showed missing SPF, DNS, and DMARC records ‚Üí **Spoofing likely**.

### 3. **Header Analysis (Google MessageHeader Tool)**
- Return-Path mismatches sender
- Source IP traced to suspicious Russian host
- Authentication results: **SPF: softfail, DNS: fail, DMARC: fail**

### 4. **Attachment & Link Scan (VirusTotal/Hybrid Analysis)**
- File: `Account_Verification_Form.zip` containing dummy `verify.exe`
- Scan result: **0/60 engines flagged it**
- Explanation: Undetected doesn‚Äôt mean safe. Many phishing attachments are **new or obfuscated**, and rely on user interaction.
-Link :- http://secure-update-login.com/verify
- VirusTotal scan showing 1/97 detection by ESET
Explanation that even 1 flagged vendor is a red flag

### 5. **Urgency and Threat Tactics**
- Language like ‚Äúurgent‚Äù, ‚Äú24 hours‚Äù, ‚Äúaccount suspended‚Äù creates pressure.
- A classic social engineering tactic.

### 6. **Mismatched or Masked URLs**
- Hovering on link: Appears like a trusted domain but redirects elsewhere.
- In this case, the domain is fake and unauthenticated.

### 7. **Poor Language or Grammar**
- No personalization ("Dear User")
- Missing branding and signature
- Basic formatting ‚Äì signs of a mass phishing email

### 8. **Summary of Threat Indicators**
- Spoofed email domain
- Failed email authentication (SPF/DKIM/DMARC)
- Attachment that could carry malware
- Social engineering and urgency
- VirusTotal didn‚Äôt flag it ‚Äì but it‚Äôs still dangerous
